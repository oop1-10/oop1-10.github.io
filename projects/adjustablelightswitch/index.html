                        <p>My project is a Automatic Light Switch <strong>(ALS)</strong>, which is similar to the sensors in
                            streetlights that automatically detect low light environments and turns on the light post
                            automatically to illuminate the area. When I began this project, I wanted to improve
                            and build on my previous bonus project, which was similar, and I believe that goal was achieved. I 
                            found the inspiration for this project by realizing that a lot of street lights are not functional, or
                            manually turn on depending on the time. I thought that creating a product that can fix these issues 
                            by improving and restoring urban infrastructure would be beneficial to drivers and pedestrians in Toronto. 
                            Since turning on at a specific time could lead to waste, and since some days are brighter than others, this
                            device could effectively save energy by only turning on the light when it’s needed.</p>
